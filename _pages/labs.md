## CTF: Network Vulnerability Assessment
**Problem:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a test network environment  
**Approach:**  
- Conducted port scanning with Nmap
- Identified vulnerable services
- Exploited misconfigured FTP service  
**Tools:** Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark  
**Lesson:** Importance of service hardening and regular patching

## Home Lab: Virtualized Enterprise Network
**Challenge:** Build a functional enterprise network with limited hardware  
**Solution:**  
- Created VMware ESXi host with nested virtualization
- Configured pfSense firewall
- Implemented VLAN segmentation  
**Outcome:** Fully functional test environment for security experiments

## Fiber Optics: Splicing Challenge
**Objective:** Achieve <0.3dB loss in field conditions  
**Method:**  
- Proper fiber preparation and cleaning
- Precision alignment using Fujikura splicer
- Protective sleeve application  
**Result:** Consistent 0.25dB average loss across 50 splices
